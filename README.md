**AI-Powered Carbon Footprint Estimation from 3D CAD Models**
<br>


As the world accelerates toward carbon neutrality, sustainable design has evolved from a choice into an engineering necessity. Modern design teams, manufacturers, and product developers are rethinking how products are conceptualized, modeled, and produced and at the core of this transformation lies Computer-Aided Design (CAD).

This project builds upon that transformation by introducing an **AI-driven solution that converts 3D CAD models into actionable sustainability insights**. By automatically extracting information such as material composition, mass, surface area, and machining process from CAD files, the system links these parameters with verified emission factor databases to instantly estimate the carbon footprint of a component.

Instead of relying on long and complex **Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs)**, engineers can now obtain real-time environmental feedback during the design phase enabling smarter choices of materials, optimized geometries to minimize waste, and reduced manufacturing energy consumption.

In essence, this project bridges the gap between digital product design and environmental intelligence, empowering engineers to create lighter, cleaner, and more sustainable products directly within their CAD environment.

## The Growing Demand for Sustainability in Engineering

Global climate goals and carbon-neutrality commitments are driving industries to drastically cut emissions. Governments are enforcing stricter environmental regulations, and consumers increasingly favor eco-friendly products placing sustainability at the core of modern engineering.

Since up to 80% of a productâ€™s environmental impact is determined during the design phase, engineers play a decisive role in achieving sustainable outcomes. With advanced CAD tools integrating material, energy, and process analysis, designers can now make informed, sustainability-driven decisions throughout the product lifecycle.
## How Weâ€™re Making Design Sustainable

In this project, sustainable design goes beyond simply reducing material usage it integrates environmental intelligence directly into the CAD environment. A sustainable design considers the full product lifecycle, using data-driven insights to guide choices such as:

**Material selection:** Choosing recyclable, renewable, or low-carbon materials identified through emission factor databases.

**Manufacturing efficiency:** Optimizing machining processes to minimize energy consumption and scrap generation.


**Lifecycle awareness:** Estimating environmental impact from raw material extraction to end-of-life within the CAD workflow.

**Real-time feedback:** Providing engineers with instant carbon footprint estimates to support informed, sustainable decisions.

By embedding these principles into the design phase, this project empowers engineers to create smarter, cleaner, and more resource-efficient products aligning innovation with sustainability goals.
